#Guessing Game-
#Write a program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100
#and has players guess the number. Rules:
#1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100 return 'OUT OF BOUNDS'
#2. On a player's first turn if their guess is:
#(a) within 10 of the number, return 'WARM'
#(b)further than 10 from the number, return 'COLD'
#3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is:
#(a) closer to the number than the previous guess, return 'WARMER'
#(b) farther from the number than the previous guess, return 'COLDER'
#4.When the player's guess equals the number, return correct and the number of guesses.
