Write a program that console logs the numbers from 1 to n.
For multiples of three print 'fizz' instead of the number
and for multiples of five print 'buzz'.  For numbers which are
multiples of both three and five print 'fizzbuzz'.

//The real challenge of this is determining when the number is
//a multiple of both three and five - modulo operator helps this!
